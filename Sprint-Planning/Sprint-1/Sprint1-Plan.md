# Sprint 1 Plan

## Sprint Duration
2 weeks

## Team Capacity
The team consists of 6 members contributing approximately 6 hours per week each. Over a 2-week sprint, this equals 72 total available hours.

Accounting for role distribution (Product Owner, Scrum Master, UI/UX) and onboarding to new technologies (Next.js, Supabase, Playwright), the estimated effective development capacity is approximately 45–50 hours.

## Forecasted Velocity
Based on relative estimation and expected team capacity, the team forecasts completing 18 story points during Sprint 1.

## Selected Sprint Backlog Items

- User account creation – 5 pts  
- Create adventure-based user profile – 3 pts  
- Set adventure preferences – 3 pts  
- Edit or delete profile – 3 pts  
- Log out securely – 1 pt  
- View matched user profiles (UI stub) – 2 pts  

Total: 17 story points

## Sprint Goal
Establish the core authentication and profile management features of Outty, enabling users to create accounts, define preferences, and manage their profiles securely.

## Rationale
Sprint 1 prioritizes foundational functionality required for all future features. Authentication and profile management are technical prerequisites for matching, messaging, and filtering functionality. Completing these items reduces architectural risk and enables meaningful validation of the product’s core data model before implementing more complex matching logic.

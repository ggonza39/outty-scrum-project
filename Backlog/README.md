## Backlog Ordering Rationale

The product backlog is ordered based on business value, technical dependencies, and risk reduction.

Foundational features such as user account creation and profile setup are prioritized first because they are prerequisites for all other functionality. Core matching functionality is prioritized next to validate the primary value proposition of the application. Communication and media features follow once successful matches can be established. Lower-risk and enhancement features, such as profile editing and logout, are placed later in the backlog due to their lower complexity and dependency on previously implemented features.

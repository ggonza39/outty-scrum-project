## Definition of Ready (DoR)

A Product Backlog Item (PBI) is considered **Ready** when it meets all of the following criteria. Only backlog items that satisfy this Definition of Ready may be selected for sprint planning and moved into a sprint.

### 1. Title
The backlog item has a clear, concise, and descriptive title that accurately reflects the intended functionality or outcome.

### 2. User Story Format
The backlog item is written using the standard user story format:

- As a *[type of user]*, I want *[some goal]* so that *[some reason]*.

### 3. Additional Details
The backlog item includes sufficient information to be clearly understood by the development team, including:
- Acceptance criteria or clarifying notes, when applicable  
- Identified dependencies, assumptions, or constraints  

### 4. Estimated in Story Points
The backlog item has been estimated using story points based on relative complexity, effort, and uncertainty.
Estimation is performed by comparing the item to other backlog items rather than using time-based estimates.

Backlog items that do not meet all of the above criteria are considered **not ready** and will remain in the product backlog until they are refined.

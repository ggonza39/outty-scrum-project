## Project Overview
Outty is an adventure-focused matching application designed to connect individuals who are interested in outdoor and experiential activities such as hiking, camping, climbing, and travel-based exploration. The primary goal of the application is to support meaningful connections by matching users based on shared activity interests, experience levels, and availability rather than relying solely on profile-based or appearance-driven matching.

Unlike traditional dating or social networking applications, Outty emphasizes activity compatibility as the core matching criterion. Users create profiles that capture relevant preferences, skill levels, and interests, which are then used to support a structured matching process. The application is intended to support both social and dating use cases, allowing users to connect with others who share similar interests in outdoor and adventure-oriented experiences.

From a software engineering perspective, this project focuses on applying agile development practices to the design and implementation of a real-world, user-centered web application. The system is designed as a modern web application using a component-based front-end, a cloud-hosted backend, and an integrated authentication and data storage solution. The project will be developed incrementally using Scrum, with an emphasis on backlog refinement, iterative delivery, and collaborative development.

## Tools & Collaboration

The Outty project uses the following tools to support collaboration, design, and agile project management:

- **Version Control & Project Management:** GitHub  
  GitHub is used to host the source code repository, manage the product backlog, track issues, and document project artifacts. GitHub Issues and project boards support sprint planning and task coordination.

- **UI/UX Design:** Figma  
  Figma is used to collaboratively design and prototype the user interface. One team member is proficient with Figma and leads UI/UX design efforts.

- **Frontend Development:** Next.js (React + TypeScript)  
  Next.js is used to implement the component-based frontend of the web application. It provides routing, server-side rendering capabilities, and a structured development environment suitable for scalable web applications. TypeScript is used to improve maintainability, enhance code reliability, and reduce runtime errors through static type checking.

- **Backend & Database Infrastructure:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, APIs)  
  Supabase provides backend infrastructure for the application, including:
  - A centrally managed PostgreSQL database
  - Built-in user authentication and authorization
  - Auto-generated RESTful APIs
  - Real-time data capabilities

  This enables rapid development while maintaining a structured and scalable backend architecture.

- **Runtime & Package Management:** Node.js and npm  
  Node.js provides the runtime environment for developing and running the Next.js application. npm is used for dependency management, package installation, and project scripts, ensuring consistent development environments across team members.


- **Hosting:** Vercel  
  Vercel is used to host and deploy the Next.js application. It provides automated builds, continuous deployment from the GitHub repository, and environment variable management. Vercel also supports preview deployments, allowing the team to test changes safely before production release.

  
- **Team Communication:** Microsoft Teams  
  Microsoft Teams is used for team communication, including meetings, discussions, and coordination throughout the Scrum process.

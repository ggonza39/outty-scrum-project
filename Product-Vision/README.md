# Product Vision – Outty

## Far Vision
Outty’s long-term vision is to serve as a specialized matching platform for individuals seeking outdoor and adventure-based connections. The product aims to support meaningful interactions by prioritizing shared activities, experience levels, and exploration interests rather than relying on generalized matching criteria. Over time, Outty is envisioned as a trusted community that enables users to safely connect, coordinate activities, and build relationships centered around outdoor experiences across diverse locations and backgrounds.

From a broader perspective, the platform aspires to demonstrate how domain-specific matching systems can improve user satisfaction and engagement when compared to generalized social or dating applications.

## Near Vision
In the near term, the goal of Outty is to deliver a working prototype that demonstrates the core value proposition of activity-based matching. The initial release will focus on a limited but complete set of features that allow users to:

- Create and manage an adventure-focused user profile  
- Specify preferred outdoor activities and self-assessed skill levels  
- Discover and match with nearby users through a swipe-based matching interface  
- Communicate with matched users to coordinate outings or initiate conversations  

The near-term vision emphasizes validating core functionality, usability, and alignment with user needs before introducing advanced features, performance optimizations, or broader platform scalability.

## Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders for the Outty project include:

- **End users:** Outdoor enthusiasts and individuals seeking adventure-oriented social or dating connections  
- **Product Owner and development team:** Responsible for defining the product vision, prioritizing backlog items, and delivering working increments  
- **Course instructors and evaluators:** Assessing the project’s adherence to Scrum practices, technical execution, and documentation quality  
- **Potential future stakeholders:** External partners such as outdoor brands, guides, or event organizers who could integrate with or extend the platform in later iterations
